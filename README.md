As an essential component for all Rajalakshmi Engineering College (REC) students, the web interface provided by [rajalakshmi.in](http://rajalakshmi.in/UI/Modules/Login/UniLogin.aspx) is outdated and lacks the necessary functionality required to meet the needs of the students. 

Therefore, the introduction of the REC bot has become necessary to fetch and view the results in a timely and efficient manner. This will enable students to access their results easily and effectively without any inconvenience.
                  
## Features

- Removes the need to use a browser to access the data
- Allows students to access their data with only their roll number and therefore does not involve any authentication process

- Provides a plethora of features such as:
    - marks - fetch internal marks
    - grades - fetch semester grades
    - attendance - fetch attendance
    - result - fetch recent results
    
## Usage
To use REC bot, simply input your roll number and select the feature you would like to use. REC bot will provide the requested data in a matter of seconds.
